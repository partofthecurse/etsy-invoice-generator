# etsy-invoice-generator
Etsy does not provide automated invoices. but you can download a csv with the articles and customers. i made a python script to loop through the spreadsheet and create automated invoices. as i am not a programmer, it has flaws and limitations. don't expect too much.

## Guide for total noobs like me:
- install python on your computer
- open the powershell (win + r - cmd)
- install lxml with pip install lxml
- download your csv from etsy - settings - options - data download (pick ordered articles, month and year)
- put in same folder as the downloaded files from here
- now open the template file with inkscape, fill in your company informations and logo and save it.
- double click generate.bat
- enjoy :)
